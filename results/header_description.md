# Explanation of Results File Headers

This file explains each column header found in the results dictionary generated by the experiment runner.

### Header Descriptions

- **alg**: The name of the optimisation algorithm used (e.g., PSO, CAB, GWO, ABC).

- **seed**: The random seed used to initialise the run, ensuring reproducibility across different iterations.

- **train**: The raw fitness score (e.g., profit) obtained on the training dataset using the best-discovered parameter set.

- **test**: The raw fitness score obtained on the unseen test dataset using the same best-discovered parameter set. This helps assess generalisation.

- **theta**: The hyperparameter vector used to define the trading strategy:
  - `d1`: window length for the fast indicator
  - `t1`: indicator type for fast (0=sma, 1=lma, 2=ema, 3=macd)
  - `a1`: smoothing factor for fast indicator
  - `d2`: window length for the slow indicator
  - `t2`: indicator type for slow
  - `a2`: smoothing factor for slow indicator
  - `buy_delay`: buy delay before acting on a signal
  - `sell_delay`: buy delay before acting on a signal

- **pop_size**: The number of individuals in the optimiser's population.

- **gens**: Total number of generations executed during the run.

- **stalled_gens**: The number of generations since the last improvement to the best fitness. Used for early stopping if applicable.

- **tolerance**: Minimum change in fitness required to reset the patience counter.

- **patience**: Maximum number of `stalled_gens` allowed before terminating the run early.

- **fitness_history**: A list of fitness values (typically the best per generation) recorded across all generations. Useful for plotting convergence curves.

- **time(seconds)**: Total runtime of the experiment for the optimiser in seconds.
